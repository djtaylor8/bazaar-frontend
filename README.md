# Bazaar - React App with Rails API

Built using React, Bazaar is an e-commerce application that utilizes Redux-Thunk, Material UI, and the Stripe API. This is my final portfolio project as part of the Flatiron School software engineering program.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing

Make sure you have Ruby, Rails, React, and PostgreSQL installed on your device.

Clone the backend repo [here](https://github.com/djtaylor8/bazaar-api) and run ```bundle install```.

Create the database and run migrations by running rails db:create and rails db:migrate. Sample products from the Fake Store API will be added to the database after running ```rails db:seed```. Finally, start the server by running ```rails s```.

After cloning this frontend repo, cd into it and run ```npm install``` to load necessary dependencies, and ```npm run``` to view in your browser.
